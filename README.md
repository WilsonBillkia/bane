# BaNE(Baremetal Node Erector) v0.8


Bane builds blockchain nodes directly to SSH enabled *nix systems.

## Project Goals: 

### Positive Social Impact
* Reduce or entirely remove cloud and hosting costs from projects
* Lower technical and cost barriers for node operation
* Enable potentially eco friendly reuse of obsolete tech
* Enable low power nodes such as Raspberry Pi  


### Secure. 
* Help decentralise networks 
* Compliance with the ISO 27001 Information Security Standard 
* Harden nodes by reducing attack surface; no management agents (only needs python and secure shell)


## In Scope
* Automatic Chainlink Node build
* Automatic Chainlink firewall configuration
* Automatic PostGreSQL Host build (on CL node)
* Automatic Geth Node build
* Key Management


## Out of Scope
* Cloud storage, user management, policies, tags etc. 
* Intrusion Detection and Prevention 
* Web Application Firewall 
* Smart Contracts
* Application security. (eg Node.js, databases, front ends, APIâ€™s, etc)
* Legal and Compliance issues relating to Information Technology or Blockchain.



V.08 Includes    
* a chainlink node with go, node.js, yarn, and postgresql installed  
* an ethereum node with node.js installed


# Installation Instructions:

## Requirements
(For the management machine)
* Linux or Mac with Python 3.5 
* SSH 
(If you need to run Ansible from a Windows Box, I believe it will work fine in the WSL, but its maybe better to have a Linux / Mac management system as Ansible  leverages *nix conventions to work well and sometimes it does not play nice with Windows as a matter of form. However for simple admin of a fleet of nodes it should be sufficient)

(For the nodes)
* Linux, Mac, or Raspberry Pi (Raspbian or Ubuntu 20 Server)
* V0.8 tested on Ansible 2.9.19, Ubuntu Server 20.04, Python 3.69


On your management machine with ansible installed, git clone bane and cd into the directory 

```
git clone https://github.com/WilsonBillkia/bane.git && cd bane
```
(Optional - but recommended, especially for production systems)
Generate an rsa keypair in your working directory: (When prompted for a password just press enter twice and put the key under ISO27001 compliant management) 

This is for the ethereum node
```
ssh-keygen -f vitalik -C "vitaliks key"
```
and for the Chainlink box
```
ssh-keygen -f sergey -C "sergeys key"
```

You will have two keyfiles in your working directory for each command. (WARNING - use appropriate ISMS for your keys)

To copy the keys to the machines:

```
ssh-copy-id -i <KEY FILE> <BOOTACCOUNT>@<IPADDRESS> 
```
Bane needs the optional core community libraries to be installed to ansible using the ansible-galaxy package manager

```
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general 
```

# Build a Chainlink / PostgreSQL Node
System Requirements (Always check with offical documentation)

Run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook sergey.yml -i hosts --ask-pass -kK
```

sergey.yml is an ansible 'playbook' with steps to install geth and node.js.  
The -i switch loads the hosts file we use for asset management. You just add the IP addresses of any nodes to the relevant group within the file (links or ethers)
The -kK switch gathers passwords from operator for ssh and sudo if tasks require it


# Build a GETH Node
System Requirements (Always check with offical Ethereum documentation)

Run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook vitalik.yml -i hosts --ask-pass -kK
```




## Removed
* The (excellent) DoD STiG hardening scripts developed here (https://github.com/openstack/ansible-hardening)
* Vagrant & Virtualbox pipeline used in the Alpha

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible for anything you do with this. 

## A Word on Risk Management
This is not a substitute for a risk assessment. The build guide is based on a free, unqualified understanding of the threats and risks operating with blockchain data and networks.
Any enterprise using Bane should be risk managed on its own merits.

## (Not required but strongly recommended) 
* Fixed IP / DHCP host reservation on your network.  
Your IP address stops changing on system builds ns restarts, which makes the workflow significantly more practical. (See the manufacturers guidance.)
