# BaNE(Baremetal Node Erector)
*THIS VERSION IS A TEST AND WILL NOT DEPLOY*

Bane builds configurations a la Docker, but directly to bare metal or SSH enabled cloud compute.
It uses Linux / Bash native tooling to reduce the attack surface while still providing Dev and Operations with an easy way to build and manage their Nodes.


## Requirements
(For the management machine)
* A Linux or Mac machine with Python 3.5 or Python 2.7 
* SSH 

(For the nodes)
* A Linux or Mac machine with Python 3.5 or Python 2.6 

If you need to run Ansible from a Windows Box, I believe the WSL is your best bet, but overall it would be better to have a Linux / Mac management system as Ansible absolutely leverages *nix conventions to work well and it does not play nice with Windows as a matter of form sadly.

## Project Goals:
### Positive Social Impact
* Lower the cost for node operation.
* Lower the difficulty of node operation
* Enable potential reuse of obsolete pcs
* Enable low power nodes such as Raspberry Pi

### Secure. 
* Always be compliant with ISO 27001 Information Security control sets 
* Remove any management layers or attack surfaces which are not required

## In Scope
* Ubuntu Server 20.x LTS
* Raspberry Pi

## Out of Scope 
* Cloud storage, user management, policies, tags etc. 
* Intrusion Detection and Prevention 
* Web Application Firewall 
* Smart Contracts
* Application security. (eg Node.js, databases, front ends, APIâ€™s, etc)
* Legal and Compliance issues relating to Information Technology or Blockchain.

## Removed
* The (excellent) DoD STiG hardening scripts developed here (https://github.com/openstack/ansible-hardening)
* Vagrant pipeline

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible for anything you do with this. 

## A Word on Risk Management
This is not a substitute for a risk assessment. The build guide is based on a free, unqualified understanding of the threats and risks operating with blockchain data and networks.
Any enterprise using Bane should be risk managed on its own merits.

## Requirements on Host:
* Tested on Ansible 2.9.19
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
* Tested with Python 3.69

## Installation Instructions:

You will need a live Linux box, with ssh access enabled.

git clone and cd into the bane directory 

```
git clone https://github.com/WilsonBillkia/bane.git && cd bane
```

Generate an rsa keypair in your home directory: (When prompted for a password just press enter twice - use an appropriate ISMS for your keys)
This is for the ethereum node
```
ssh-keygen -f ./vitalik  
```
and for the Chainlink box
```
ssh-keygen -f ./sergey  
```


# GETH Node
System Requirements (Always check with offical Ethereum documentation)
run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook vitalik.yml -i <IPADDRESS OF BOX> -l ethers --ask-pass 
```

# Chainlink Node
System Requirements (Always check with offical Chainlink documentation)

```
ansible-playbook sergey.yml -i <IPADDRESS OF BOX> -l links --ask-pass 
```

# Chainlink Database
System Requirements (Always check with offical Chainlink documentation)

```
ansible-playbook sergey.yml -i <IPADDRESS OF BOX> -l db --ask-pass 
```

NB Host key checking on your Ansible management server may cause subsequent node spinups to error out until you clear the key from your own ssh client. I use the alias / shellscript killsshkeybane.sh to do this, which basically just replays the help from the sshd output. 

## Operation


## Architecture
The following main components were chosen for this project:

## Ansible (2.9.19)
https://www.ansible.com/ 
Ansible requires only that the node operator have access to the host via SSH. No additional agents or libraries are required. Ansible also provides simple creation and management of test environments and enterprise grade system provisioning and configuration.
NB, while Ansible is clientless there are some modules, such as gather-facts which require Python 2.7 on the host. This should not be an issue with Python 3.

## Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04.
Headless, lightweight and familiar Linux distribution with good support.
