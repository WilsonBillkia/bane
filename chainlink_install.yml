# NB If this script errors out while gathering facts, its almost certainly because APT is running update daemon on the guests
# This can happen just after boot. Just try it again - it only needs to run successfully once. You can ssh into the machine 
# as well to check whether its APT 
# TODO put in an error check for this and perform retry
